# Hi there üëã I'm Leo
I'm a Physics graduate from National Cheng Kung University (NCKU), currently
transitioning into Embedded Systems and Systems Programming. 
I am passionate about building reliable low-level software that bridges
hardware and high-level applications, especially in safety-critical and
mission-driven domains like aerospace and robotics.

## üöÄ My Current Focus
- Studying in the **Embedded Systems Certificate Program at UC San Diego
Extension**
